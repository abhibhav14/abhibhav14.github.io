## Sambar

Here is how I make sambar.
Given that I have only been cooking for a few months and have probably only made sambar about ten or fifteen times, everything here should be taken with a grain of salt.
This method is a slight modification of the method my family uses to make sambar, and therefore the only promise is that this method will result in a sambar that tastes very similar to the sambar I grew up eating at home.
There are some other methods of making sambar that I have tried and have not liked, and there are even more methods that I have yet to try.
Some of these I have listed at the end of this page.


Finally, this is not only a first draft but also the first time I am writing about cooking, I hope this at least partially excuses the poor quality of this post.
Right now, the ingredient quantities are far from exact (whatever that means when cooking), and there are no pictures.

### Ingredients
The quantities are roughly what you need to make three meals worth of sambar rice.

- Toor dal (1 cup)
- Vegetables. I add about one bowl full of chopped vegetables, excluding the onions.
    - Carrots
    - Radish
    - Tomato. I feel like too much tomato takes away from the flavour of the tamarind, so I add only about one large tomato.
    - Brinjal
    - Onion. I usually use only red onions. Pearl onions go great with sambar, but they are hard to find, and are significantly more expensive. I add one large onion (a little less if I am also using pearl onions).
- More vegetables. These are vegetables that are harder to find here, so I do not always add them.
    - Drumstick
    - Any gourd type vegetable, like bottle gourd or chayote.
- Sambar podi/masala. For now I use a store bought podi, mainly because grinding dal in a mortar and pestle is very tedious. In the future I plan to get a spice blender and make my own podi, and also try to make arachuvitta sambar.
- Spices
    - Mustard seeds
    - Fenugreek seeds
    - Curry leaves
    - Dried red chillies
    - Turmeric powder
- Tamarind (30 grams). In my opinion the most important ingredient. I use tamarind pulp from Thailand, this is easily available anywhere where they sell asian stuff.
- Coriander
- Jaggery

### The method
Cooking sambar involves prepping the dal, prepping the vegetables, prepping the tamarind, and putting it all together.

#### Prepping the dal
Wash the dal a couple of times and soak it for about an hour if possible.
Put the dal in a pressure cooker with some water, salt, turmeric, and a little bit of oil.
The amount of water depends on how long the dal was soaked.
If the dal is not soaked at all, add about three cups of water.
If it has been soaking for over an hour, you only need enough water to cover the dal by three or four centimeters.
Pressure cook this dal for about twenty minutes after the first whistle.
Finally, using a whisk or a spoon, mash all the dal (which should be very soft by this point).
Unlike dal (the dish), the dal here needs to completely break apart, which is why it is cooked for so long.
Chunky dal is the bane of sambar - if the dal is not soft enough to make completely homogeneous, pressure cook it for some more time.


#### Prepping the vegetables
For carrots, radish, tomatoes and brinjal, cut the vegetables into bite sized pieces and pressure cook it for about ten minutes with some salt, turmeric, and a little bit of oil.
By the end, the tomatoes and brinjal should be soft enough that stirring the mixture with a spoon causes them to break.
The radish and carrots should still hold shape, but should soft and completely cooked through.

For the gourd and drumstick, boil them for about ten and fifteen minutes respectively in water with a little bit of salt.

Since the vegetables need a lot less time to pressure cook than the dal, they usually have to be prepped separately.
However, if the dal is soaked for about six or seven hours, then the dal and vegetables can be pressure cooked together, for about ten or twelve minutes.
This is what I usually do, unless I am cooking enough sambar for more than five meals.

#### Prepping the tamarind
Break the tamarind pulp into small pieces, put them in a bowl, and pour some boiling water into the bowl.
Use a spoon to further loosen up the pieces of the pulp.
Let this sit for twenty or thirty minutes.
Remove the seeds and the fibres while squeezing out as much pulp as possible.

#### Putting it all together
In a pot, add ghee and oil.
Only oil also works, although ghee adds a lot to the flavour.
When the oil/ghee is hot, add mustard seeds, red chillies and fenugreek seeds.
Fenugreek seeds are extremely bitter, and anyone who has eaten a lot of sambar has experienced biting into one accidentally, so make sure not to use too much, and that the seeds get cooked well.
Add the curry leaves, and after a few seconds the onions.
Let the onions cook for a few minutes.
Once they are translucent, add about a heaping tablespoon and a half of sambar podi.
Add some turmeric.
Depending on the sambar podi, add some red chilli powder and some hing.
Once the podi has cooked for a couple of minutes, add the prepped tamarind pulp and water, along with a small piece of jaggery, and some coriander stems.
Let this cook for about three minutes.
Add the prepped lentil and vegetables, mix and add salt to taste.
After the sambar reaches a boil, taste it, and add more sambar podi if required.
The easiest way to add the podi at this stage is to mix it with a little oil in a separate bowl and add the paste.
At this point the taste of the tamarind should be quite strong, the longer you cook it the milder it gets.
Whenever you feel like the tamarind has cooked enough, turn off the heat and add coriander leaves.

### Some stuff I have tried and some stuff I plan to try
A lot of recipes call for the vegetables to be cooked in the pot along with the tamarind as opposed to pressure cooking them or cooking them separately.
I have tried this, and I find that cooking the tamarind for so long tends to remove its flavour completely, to the point where the dominant sour taste becomes that of the tomato.
One thing I have not yet tried is cooking the vegetables in the pot and adding the tamarind later, this might fix the above problem.

Another difference of the above from a lot of recipes is the lack of tadka.
Many places add the mustard, fenugreek and curry leaves at the end in a tadka along with some urad dal.
I feel like this will make the fenugreek seed problem worse but is worth a shot.

Finally, there a bunch of other vegetables like ladies finger, spinach, and potato that I have not yet tried adding to sambar, and I plan to do so soon.
