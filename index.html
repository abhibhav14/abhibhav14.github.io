<p>
I am a student in the computer science department of IIT Kanpur, currently in the masters part of my dual B.Tech and M.Tech degree. My advisor is Nitin Saxena.
</p>

<p>
I am interested in complexity theory, in particular in algebraic complexity. I am also interested in computational algebra and number theory.
</p>
<br>
Here are some reports/exposition:
<ul>
  <li><a href="./map.pdf">Algebraic independence and polynomial maps</a></li>
  <li><a href="./wronskian.pdf">A multivariate folded wronskian</a></li>
  <li><a href="./pssni.pdf">Functional dependence via newton iteration</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
<a href="./talks.html">Here</a> are some other miscellaneous slides and reports from various talks.
</p>
<br>
<p>
I co-organise the special interest group on theoretical aspects of computer science at IIT Kanpur. If you are interested in giving a talk, please email me, or drop by RM201.
